I am a master's student at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at UC Santa Barbara, specializing in Coastal Marine Resources Management. I am passionate about marine conservation and protecting marine ecosystems worldwide from the effects of climate change, overfishing, coastal development, and more for the benefit of the communities that rely on them.
