I am a marine conservationist and graduate of the Bren School at UC Santa Barbara with a master's degree in Environmental Science and Management, including a specialization in Coastal Marine Resources Management. I am currently working as a Waterfront/Research Assistant at the School for Field Studies' Center for Marine Resource Studies in the Turks and Caicos Islands, where I help teach marine science and scuba diving to undergraduate study abroad students, conduct marine research projects, and assist with implementation of a coral restoration project. I am passionate about protecting and restoring marine ecosystems worldwide for the benefit of communities that rely on them. I have extensive experience in scientific data management and analysis (including spatial data), science communication (including writing, social media, and film-making), education, and marine research techniques.
